# Portfolio: RAG & Agentic AI Systems (IBM Professional Certificate) 🚀

This repository showcases my hands-on work and learning outcomes from the **IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate**.  
The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to **design, reason about, and build agentic AI systems**—not just use prompts.

I focus on **real-world patterns** such as retrieval pipelines, stateful agents, tool integration, and workflow orchestration.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system design  
- Agentic AI workflows with planning, tools, and state  
- LangChain and LangGraph for multi-step reasoning  
- Prompt engineering with clear task boundaries  
- Debugging and improving agent behavior  
- Translating concepts into interview-ready explanations

## 📂 What You’ll Find in This Repository

- 📓 Concept notes explained in plain language  
- 🧪 Small experiments and demos  
- 🧩 Agent workflows with state and conditional logic  
- ⚠️ Common mistakes and lessons learned  
- 🎯 One-line takeaways useful for interviews  

Each section is structured to show **how I think**, not just what I built.

## 🛠️ Current Status

This is an **active portfolio**.  
I continuously refine explanations, improve designs, and add new examples as I deepen my understanding of agentic systems.

Planned additions:
- End-to-end RAG mini-projects  
- Multi-node LangGraph agent examples  
- Design notes comparing chains vs graphs  
- Evaluation and failure-case analysis
